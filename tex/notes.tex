Angles:

1) Extraction 
	-- What is a clear contribution in extraction that is missing in existing systems?
	-- Is the output new? If so, what changes are needed to existing systems to arrive at this output.
	-- If the output is new, then you have to motivate why this output is helpful. 
	
2) QA with SRL and Frame-Semantic based systems 
	-- Is there a new attempt here? Previous QA systems did just matching? 

Are definitions somehow fundamentally different from instances?
The big problem is still entailment -- representation and sense issues are the key? 
4th grade QA is different from open-domain or terrorist domain QA in that it requires more understanding? 
Are process recognition questions unique in some respect, compared to general purpose QA? 
	-- Yes, in the sense that we don't have to do other types of reasoning (qualitative comparison etc.)

Build on SRL and Frame-Semantic Parsing systems 
	-- Don't invent a new formulation. Pick one.
	
	

The most exciting narrative is where the output is new. That is we are reading information about processes into a structured representation, that goes beyond processing single sentences. In particular we are reading inferential knowledge. 

input(x) is-a liquid
output(x) is-a vapor
enabler(x) is-a heat-source
	=> evaporation
	
Some of this falls into deductive reasoning and some into abductive.
