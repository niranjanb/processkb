\section{Role Assessment and Discovery}

Inference yields a set of role fillers that can be reliably identified from the input set of sentences. 
The yield is limited by the set of roles and the query patterns used to retrieve sentences for these roles.

{\bf Assessment}

To expand the knowledge further, we propose an iterative procedure that learns from the inferred roles
to find new query patterns. We propose to build a confidence function that assesses the coverage
of roles for each process.


{\bf Role Discovery}

For many processes there are specific important roles that do not fit any of the general roles. Some examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Phototropism} is the mechanism by which plants grow towards a light source. 
The notion of a target {\em light source} and the {\em direction} or {\em orientation} of the growth
are critical for distinguishing positive and negative phototropism. However, neither notion fits
with any of the existing roles. 
\item {\em Heat transfer} processes such as radiation have notion of a {\em medium} 
which is critical for distinguishing between instances such as convection and radiation
Again medium doesn't fit with any existing roles. 
\end{itemize}

We propose a role assessment mechanism that attempts to identify frequently repeated arguments
and assess how well they fit with existing roles. If a frequently repeated argument is assigned no role
or is not assigned to any particular role with high confidence then we propose to induce a new role 
for such arguments.
